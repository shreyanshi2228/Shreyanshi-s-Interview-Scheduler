# Shreyanshi-s-Interview-Scheduler
An interview creation page where the admin can create an interview by selecting participants, start time and end time. Backend should throw error with proper error message if: 
1. Any of the participants is not available during the scheduled time (i.e, has another interview scheduled).
2. No of participants is less than 2. 
3. An interviews list page where admin can see all the upcoming interviews.
